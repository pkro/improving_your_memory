## Memory principles

The short term memory can memorize about 7 (+/-2) items (Millers law).

### Repetition

Repetition: finding ways of repeating / rehearsing information. The foundation of improving memory.

- write down
- repeat it
- quiz yourself

### Exaggeration

If something is exaggerated / absurd / ridiculous it's easier to remember. Examples given: month of february has an "exaggerated" low number of days compared to the other months, which all have 30 or 31; celebrities in memorable outfits.

Can be used as a memorization technique.

### Chunking

Chunking a lot of singular items into easier to memorize groups.

Examples:

- chunking numbers, e.g. turning 3128575757 into 312-857-4747
- Categorizing a grocery list by areas of the store or type (dairy, meat, produce)

### Association

Making information meaningful.

Baker/baker paradox: Names are more easily forgotten than other associations (given a photo of a person with the information that his name is "Mr. Baker" is harder to remember than "this guy is a baker").

The information of the occupation "baker" has more associations (bakers hat, smells, food etc.) and is thus easier to remember.

### Pictures

Visual information (e.g. Face of a person) is much easier to remember than abstract information (e.g. name). 

Memoization example (the example is of course made to be easily chunkable):

Remember the letters

X I B M P H D A C T M T V X

*Chunk* it into meaningful chunks or patterns with *associations" and imagine a *picture* or scene with it. As the scene is usually strange, it also uses the *exaggeration* technique.

- X ... X is the "canvas" (a pattern, not a chunk) - bookends to the story
- IBM (company, remember logo or just "IBM")
- PHD (doctorate, remember doctors hat)
- ACT (actor = costume)
- MTV (music television, logo)

"X At IBM there works a doctor who is also an actor on MTV X" or
an Image of an IBM worker with a doctors hat studying at his desk for the ACT test while watching MTV. 

-> short term memory "doubled" (remembering 14 items)

## Memory techniques

### Using mnemonic devices

Examples:

- Sentences:
    - treble clef key note lines from bottom to top: "**E**very **G**ood **B**oy **D**oes **F**ine" (german (B is H): Ein Guter Hund Darf Fast Alles).
    - Order of mathematical operations:
        - **P**lease (parenthesis)
        - **E**xcuse (exponents)
        - **M**y (multiplication)
        - **D**ear (division)
        - **A**unt (addition)
        - **S**ally (subtraction)
- Physically
    - Knuckle mnemonic for days of month
- Images

To easily get mnemonics for common topics, search for *keyword* mnemonic or *stichwort* eselsbrÃ¼cke.

### Note-taking techniques

Taking notes is a form of repetition (even without referring back to them later).

- Highlighting
- Make notes in margins
- Underline
- Use note taking app

Outlines are good for sequential information (historic dates etc.).

Another organized approach to note-taking for information that is not sequential that mimics more how the mind works: *mind mapping*, including colors and visuals. Good for topics that don't have a set order:

Example of this readme up to this point, generated using [markmap](https://markmap.js.org/repl) (though pen and paper might be more effective):

### Verbalization - using songs, rhymes, and alliteration

Songs:

- "ABC" alphabet mnemonic song
- Text is easier to remember as a song
- Learning languages is more effective when singing the words than speaking them

This works by

- various forms of repetition (the song itself and its individual parts such as chorus, beats etc.)
- linking the melody to easily remembered emotions, e.g. a favorite song or a melody tied to a specific event

Other techniques:

- Rhymes (utilizes auditory memory strength)
- Alliteration ("**S**uper **S**ummer **S**ale"); Can help remembering names: "Tall Tim" or "Talkative Tim" (association + alliteration)


### The story method

The human mind is wired to remember stories.

- Try to remember a specific set of details in the form of a story (and exaggerate!) like the PHD at IBM acting on MTV.

### The link system

Linking one item to another (memory chain). For remembering sequential things (a speech or a process).

Example (unrelated items, so not a real-world example):

1) pen
2) shoe
3) book
4) airplane
5) eyeglasses
6) fish
7) coffee
8) printer

Link **pen** and **shoes** and the other items using exageration - the images don't have to make sense, and it's even better if they don't:

1) Having **pens** as **shoes** (linking pens and shoes)
2) A **book** walking around in **giant shoes**
3) An airplane with an opened book as wings
4) An airplane wearing giant eyeglasses
5) A fish wearing eyeglasses 
6) A pond made of coffee with overactive fish jumping in and out
7) A printer using hot, steaming, smelling coffee as ink

Now we have just one less "item" to remember, but we can remember them as memorable images instead of words or mundane things. The order of the items in the individual pairs most often derive from the context in real world applications of the technique.

### Memory palaces and the [method of loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci)

Loci is the plural of locus (=place).

- visualize a familiar place or even a familiar walking route outside
- visualize a series of locations in a specific order within that place, in a logical order. Pieces of furniture can also serve as a location. Example: building door -> mailbox -> staircase -> front door -> hallway -> bathroom (toilet) -> bathroom (sink) -> kitchen table (eat some nuts) -> kitchen (get some water) -> living room desk (check mail) -> living room couch (relax) -> bedroom
- Place each item you need to remember at one of these places (in the correct order if order is important); visualize and exaggerate!
- rehearse the order several times

Multiple memory places can be used for different things.

### Similar sound technique

Used to remember the meaning of unfamiliar words (pretty much what I automatically do for learning spanish)

Examples: 

- claustrophobia. Claus => santa claus => imagine santa claus afraid of tight chimneys.
- Belonephobia (fear of sharp objects) => imagine a balloon ("belon") is afraid to be pierced by a sharp knife 
- Anthrophobia (fear of people) => an Ant being afraid of being stepped on by People

## Using the Mnemonic Peg System

### Linking numbers to pictures

Each number gets pegged (tied) to a visual.

1 - pencil
2 - swan
3 - McDonalds
4 - chair
5 - hook
6 - cherry
7 - lightning bolt
8 - racetrack
9 - balloon
10 - silverware and plate

### Memorizing ten items

Example: list of 10 ordered items

1) bread
2) milk
3) tomatoes
4) soda
5) turkey
6) chips
7) strawberries
8) deodorant
9) cucumber
10) cereal

Memorization:

For each item, come up with a visual that includes the number symbol and the list item (the stranger / exaggerated the better; also remember smells and tastes where applicable).

1) a pencil in a hotdog bun
2) a swan swimming in a lake of milk
3) a burger where the bun is two tomato halves
4) a chair with legs made out of soda bottles
5) a pirate with hooks as hands trying to cut a turkey
6) disgusting, cherry flavored chips
7) a tasty, strawberry colored lightning bolt
8) a sweaty race driver using deodorant
9) a cucumber shaped blimp
10) a posh person trying to eat cereal with fork and spoon on a plate 

### Memorizing more than ten items

For memorizing more than 10 items, it's best to have a theme for each group of 10 mnemonic items and utilize the existing items from 1-10. The "theme" of each 10-number group is like an additional item.

Example (let's say the 10 items above were items 11-20):

- 1-10: the common mnemonics (pen to silverware with plate); no special theme for these as these are the basics
- 11-20: black oil
  21) a pencil that leaks black oil lying on a loaf of bread and soaking it
  22) a swan covered in oil swimming on a lake of milk, leaking oil in the milk
  23) a disgusting burger made of 2 large tomato halves with oil leaking out between them
  24) a chair with legs made of soda bottles standing in a pool of oil and shaking precariously 
- 21-30: ...

Learning this system takes effort and time but gets easier in the long run.

## Situational methods

### How to remember names

1) Pay attention when being introduced and repeat the name immediately
2) Quiz yourself (when the person walks away and later that day)
3) Make a connection to the name. Link the name to someone with the same name you know or to a famous person and picture them standing next to that person (visualization and location)
4) Connect your first impression with the name, possibly using alliteration or rhymes. "Blue-Tie Bob", "Dancing David" and repeat it
5) any other of the techniques discussed

### How to remember presentations

- Don't try to remember it verbatim
- Chunk the presentation into parts / talking points
- Numeric peg system, method of loci / memory palace (organize topics in an ordered list first)
- Rehearse (repetition)

### How to remember what you read

If you don't know what to expect, you have to read slowly.

Remedy with multiple reading process:

- preview: read introduction and conclusion
- overview: read all headings (or first sentence of each paragraph) and bolded words
- read: read all the material

This also results in 3 *repetitions*, even if not complete.

- Take notes during reading

### Remembering passwords

Take a phrase that can be easily remembered and use the first letters of each word and include punctuation.

Example: "How in hell should I remember a password with 13 characters?" becomes "HihsIrapw13c?"

### Remembering important dates

- Draw dates in a timeline with colors and pictures (visual memory). 
- Rhyme / alliterations
- Use the numeric peg system in combination with the memory palace system

### Remembering numbers

- Group the digits, see chunking. 
- Turn smaller numbers into time (e.g. 12:25 instead of 1225)
- Make up a sentence where each word length is the number of a digit (I don't think that is worth it)

### Remembering formulas

Make operators part of the mnemonic peg system, e.g. division is 2 floors of a house with one item in the top and the other in the second floor, subtraction is one item taking away something from another item, X is a street intersection, "()" is hugging etc.

Rehearse the formula by making a story of the pictures.

### Remembering a to-do list

Memory palace or numeric peg system, nothing new here.

### Memorize words in foreign languages

Think of word or sound that sounds similar, visualize combinations of words, e.g. "matar" in spanish sounds similar to "martern" (torture) in german. English example: "Barco" (boat in spanish) sounds like "bark", so imagine a barking dog on a boat. "Capello" (hat in italian): imagine a Cap made of j*ello*.

### Memorizing speeches or scripts word for word

- Repetition
- Rehearsing
- Walk and talk (light exercise like walking helps memory when rehearsing)
- Chunk lines into logical parts
- Take a short nap immediately after memorizing a chunk
- "Practical" memory palace technique: practice chunks of lines in the correct chunk order in different places of your home, e.g. first chunk: hallway, second chunk: bathroom, third chunk: kitchen etc.
